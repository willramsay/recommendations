### Some Major Studies

John Ruskin, *Modern Painters*, 1843–1860
* Fri., Mar. 11. 1831 &mdash; At dinner with Goethe, talked on various subjects. “It is a peculiarity of Walter Scott's,” said he, “that his great talent in representing details often leads him into faults. Thus, in ‘Ivanhoe,’ there is a scene where they are seated at a table in a castle-hall, at night, and a stranger enters. Now, he is quite right in describing the stranger's appearance and dress, but it is a fault that he goes to the length of describing his feet, shoes, and stockings. When we sit down in the evening, and some one comes in, we see only the upper part of his body. If I describe the feet, daylight enters at once, and the scene loses its nocturnal character.” - Eckermann, Conversations with Goethe

*The whole description of the wedding is unusually good. There are some details there that simply stagger one; remembering that it is an eleven-year-old boy who wrote it, you ask yourself, "Is it possible this was just an accident?" Behind the strong, compressed description you see just the eleven-year-old boy, no taller than the table, with his bright intelligent little eyes, to whom nobody pays attention, but who notices and remembers everything. [paragraph break] When, for example, the little boy wanted some bred, Fedka did not say that the boy asked his mother for it, but that he "bent his mother down." This is said not by accident, but because Fedka is recalling his own relationship with his mother at that stage of growth, and because he remembers how that relationship receded in the presence of others, and how familiar he and his mother were when it was just the two of them. - Tolstoy, "Are the Peasent Children to Learn to Write from Us, or Are We to Learn from the Peasant Childre?"

Richard Wollheim, *Painting as an Art,* 1981 
* Paul Guyer: "Richard Wollheim (1923–2003) drew on
Wittgenstein, Freud, and a profound experience and knowledge of the
arts, above all painting, that was not distorted by exaggeration of the
importance of the twentieth-century avant-garde, to produce a philosophy of art that recognized the cognitive and expressive dimensions
of art and an interaction between artist and audience that allowed for
both mutual understanding and yet room for autonomy on each side.
Wollheim thus synthesized the three main strands of modern aesthetic
theory [to paraphrase: aesthetic experience as knowledge, as emotional experience, or as play of the imagination] that have been recognized throughout this study and in so doing
produced one of the most important aesthetic theories of the second
half of the twentieth century."
